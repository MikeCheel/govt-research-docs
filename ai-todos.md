## Current Task: Mobile Menu Optimization for Constitutional Research Document

### TASK 14: Optimize Mobile Menu and Actor Filtering System
**Status**: APPROVED - IN PROGRESS
**Description**: Improve mobile menu usability and actor filtering functionality for US_Constitutional_Subversion.html
**Requirements**:
- Fix hamburger menu button covering the title
- Prevent need for users to swipe to see full menu
- Shorten mobile menu display to fit screen better
- Ensure actor filtering shows only relevant content and verifiable links
- Improve mobile user experience and discoverability
- Test on various mobile devices and screen sizes

**Implementation Steps**:
- [x] Analyze current mobile menu CSS and JavaScript functionality
- [x] Fix hamburger menu button positioning to avoid covering title
- [x] Redesign mobile menu layout to eliminate horizontal scrolling/swiping
- [x] Optimize mobile menu height and content spacing
- [x] Enhance actor filter to prominently show verifiable links when filtering
- [x] Ensure filtered content clearly displays source citations
- [ ] Test mobile menu on various screen sizes (iPhone, Android, tablets)
- [ ] Test actor filtering functionality and link display
- [ ] Verify all navigation elements work properly on mobile

**Implementation Notes (2025-09-07)**:
- Prevented hamburger overlap with the title on mobile.
- Mobile menu opens as a two-column grid; no horizontal swiping is required; retains 75vh max-height with vertical scroll.
- Filter auto-expands matching timeline entries to reveal their Sources links.
- Added a new "Sources for [actor]" aggregated links section under the Introduction; it appears when filtering and hides when "All" is selected.
- Navigation buttons continue to hide/show in sync with filtered sections.

**Note**: This builds upon the existing navigation system in US_Constitutional_Subversion.html to improve mobile user experience.

**Note**: Task 12 (organizing MD files) has been successfully completed. All .md files have been moved to the ai-research folder as requested.
